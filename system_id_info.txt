GHRD Versions Control 
=====================

System ID in GHRD stores information related to hardware revision and feature options enabled in the design.

The 32-bit System ID is separated into three fields in the format of 0xXYYY_ZZZZ.

The most significant 4 bits, 0xX:
Represents supported development board revision (0x1 = PCB v1, 0x2 = PCB v2, etc.)

The next 12 bits, 0xYYY:
GHRD release revision. Following section describes hardware modification of each revision.
  0x001 = Base GHRD release:
          HPS peripheral: SDMMC, EMAC1, EMAC2, USB1, I2C0, UART0, GPIO, EMIF HPS (DDR4)
          FPGA peripherals: JTAG to Avalon Master Bridge, LED PIO, System ID
          System ID = 0x200112FF
  0x002 = Base GHRD release 0x001 + addition of PR region partition + PR region personas to demonstration partial reconfiguration from Linux
          System ID = 0x200212FF
  0x003 = Major update for GSRD v2022.06; moved project generation to scripted flow, enabled additional features
          System ID = 0x2003B2FF

The lower 16 bits, 0xZZZZ:
Feature options enabled in the hardware design variants (value of 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled).
  bit 0  = HPS SDMMC
  bit 1  = HPS EMAC1 (RGMII with MDIO)
  bit 2  = HPS EMAC2 (RGMII with MDIO)
  bit 3  = HPS USB1
  bit 4  = HPS I2C0
  bit 5  = HPS GPIO (2x)
  bit 6  = HPS DDR4 EMIF
  bit 7  = HPS Early I/O Release
  bit 8  = FPGA DDR4 EMIF
  bit 9  = FPGA configuration file source (1 = eMMC, 0 = EPCQ)
  bit 10 = FPGA to HPS Bridge
  bit 11 = HPS to FPGA Bridge
  bit 12 = Lightweight FPGA to HPS Bridge
  bit 13 = F2SDRAM 0 port
  bit 14 = F2SDRAM 1 port
  bit 15 = F2SDRAM 2 port
